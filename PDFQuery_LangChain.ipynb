    "\n",
    "You need a **_Serverless Cassandra with Vector Search_** database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) to run this demo. As outlined in more detail [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/quickstart.html#_prepare_for_using_your_vector_database), you should get a DB Token with role _Database Administrator_ and copy your Database ID: these connection parameters are needed momentarily.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Setup: import dependencies, provide secrets, create the LangChain vector store;\n",
    "- Run a Question-Answering loop retrieving the relevant headlines and having an LLM construct the answer."

Methodology and Major Data Sources  \\n Quarterly Estimates of GDP  are indicator based and compiled using the benchmark -indicator \\nmethod i.e. the estimates available for the same quarter of the previous financial year (2023 -24) are \\nextrapolated using the relevant indicators reflecting the performance of sectors. Data sourced from \\nvarious Ministries/Departments/Private Agencies serve as valuable inputs in the compilation of \\nthese estimates.  \\n The sector -wise estimates have been compiled using indicators /data sources viz. (i) Index of \\nIndustrial Production (IIP), (ii) Financial performance of Listed Companies in the Private Corporate \\nsector based on available quarterly financial results of these companies  for Q2 of 2024 -25, (iii) \\nProduction Targets a nd First Advance Estimates of Crop Production for 2024 -25, (iv) Production \\nTargets and summer season p roduction estimates of Major Livestock products  for 2024 -25; (v) Fi sh \\nProduction , (vi) Production/ Consumption of Cement and Steel, (vii) Net Tonne Kilometres and \\nPassenger Kilometres for Railways, (viii) Passenger and Cargo traffic handled by Civil Aviation, \\n(ix) Cargo traffic handled at Major and Minor Sea Ports, (x) Sales of Commercial Vehicles, (xi)  \\nBank Deposits and Credits, (xii) Accounts of Central and State Governments, etc., available for Q2 \\nof 2024 -25. Year -on-Year growth rates (%) in the main indicators used in the estimation are given \\nin the Annexure B. \\n Total tax revenue used for GDP compilation includes non -GST revenue as well as GST \\nrevenue. Latest available information on the websites of Controller General of Accounts (CGA) and \\nComptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) have been used for estimating taxes on products \\nat Current Prices. For compiling taxes on products at constant prices, volume extrapolation is done \\nusing volume growth of taxed goods and services  and aggregated to obtain the total volume of taxes . \\nThe total product subsidies at Curre nt prices were compiled using the information on major \\nsubsidies viz. Food, Urea, Petroleum and Nutrient based subsidy for Centre and the expenditure \\nincurred on subsidies by most States for July-September  quarter of FY  2024 -25. Lates t available \\ndata on the CGA and CAG websites for Revenue expenditure, Interest payments, Subsidies etc. \\nfrom Centre and States are used for estimating Government Final Consumption Expenditure \\n(GFCE).  \\nImproved data coverage and revision in input data made by source agencies would have a \\nbearing on subsequent revisions of these estimates. Estimates are, therefore, likely to undergo \\nrevisions for the aforesaid causes in due course, as per the release cale ndar. Users should take these \\ninto consideration while interpreting the figures. The First Advance Estimates of Annual GDP for \\nFY 2024 -25 would be released on 7.01.2025. The release of quarterly GDP estimates for the quarter \\nOctober -December  of 2024 -25 (Q 3 2024 -25) will be on 28.02.2025 . \\n***********This Press Release is embargoed against publication, telecast or circulation on internet till 4:00 pm on 29th November , 2024 . \\n8 \\n Annexure A  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n(₹ Crore)\\nQ1 Q2 Q1 Q2 Q1 Q2 Q1 Q2 Q1 Q2\\n1.
